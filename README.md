ICLR 2023

This repository hosts example code showing how to use the model using HuggingFace's `transformers` library. Code to replicate the evaluation results in our paper (in Fairseq, which we used to train the model) is coming soon!

See [our project site](https://sites.google.com/view/incoder-code-models) for more information, or [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05999), or [examples](https://sites.google.com/view/incoder-code-models/home/examples).


## Models

You can obtain the models from HuggingFace's hub:

- 6.7B parameter model: [facebook/incoder-6B](https://huggingface.co/facebook/incoder-6B)
- 1.3B parameter model: [facebook/incoder-1B](https://huggingface.co/facebook/incoder-1B)

## Tokenizer

We use a custom tokenizer, which you can load from either "facebook/incoder-1B" or "facebook/incoder-6B" (they are identical). The model was trained with padding on the left-hand side of inputs, using a `<pad>` token which has ID 1.

```
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("facebook/incoder-1B") # or "facebook/incoder-6B"
tokenizer.pad_token = "<pad>"
tokenizer.padding_side = "left"
```

When calling `tokenizer.decode`, it's important to pass `clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False` to avoid removing spaces after punctuation. For example:

`tokenizer.decode(tokenizer.encode("from ."), clean_up_tokenization_spaces=False)`

(Note: encoding prepends the `<|endoftext|>` token, as this marks the start of a document to our model. This token can be removed from the decoded output by passing `skip_special_tokens=True` to `tokenizer.decode`.)

## Requirements

`pytorch`, `tokenizers`, and `transformers`.
Our model requires HF's tokenizers >= 0.12.1, due to changes in the pretokenizer.

```
pip install torch
pip install 'tokenizers>=0.12'
pip install transformers
```

## Usage

See [example_usage.py](example_usage.py) for a demo script showing how to use the infilling capability of the model. Set BIG_MODEL = True in the script to use the 6.7B parameter model; the 1.3B will be used otherwise.

For an example of batched generation, see [example_batched_usage.py](example_batched_usage.py).


## Paper

See [our paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05999) for research details on the method, training data, models, and experimental results.
